# USACO
This repository contains solutions to USACO problems in java.

When I was competing in the USACO contest, I found that competitive programming was tailored to C++ users. There were very few solutions available for those who programmed in Java. I hope that with this resource, other students will be able to find Java solutions to various USACO problems to aid in their preperation for the USACO contest. Use this to aid in your preperation for the contest. To most effectively use this resource to aid in your preperation for USACO, first attempt the problem on your own and then refer to my solution. Please thoroughly understand all the code to best prepare for the USACO contest.
