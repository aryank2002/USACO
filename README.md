# USACO
When I was competing in the USACO contest, I found that competitive programming was tailored to C++ users. There were very few solutions available for those who programmed in Java. I hope that with this resource, other students will be able to find Java solutions to various USACO problems to aid in their preperation for the USACO contest. To most effectively use this resource to aid in your preperation for USACO, first attempt to solve the problem on your own and then refer to my solution. Please thoroughly understand all the code to best prepare for the USACO contest.

IMPORTANT NOTE: My bronze solutions reflect my coding abilities when I was in an introductory phase and as I gradually progressed through the contest divisions, my abilities improved (with the solutions in the platinum division best reflecting my current abilities). Furthermore, the vast majority of the solutions were written in a timed environment so they demonstrate coding in a concise manner and may not follow the conventional syntax in the interest of saving time during the contest.
